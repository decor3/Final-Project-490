RSA Excel Final Project
- The purpose of this project is to portray the security that you get when using the RSA Algorithm.
I used Python to add from a template that i found to get started on. My contribution was changing most
of the code so that I could get it to register in blocks instead of just in regular character by character
which I found out is not very secure at all. My project can be a little slow to run but it might just be based
off of how fast your computer is or the amount of words that you type into the program.

To run this program.
1. Hit Run
2. Select whether you want to generate a new private or public key with y or n
3. Select whether you want to encrypt with e or d.
4. If encrypting type your sentence, if decrypting type the numbers you got from your encryption
5. If encrypting, choose whether you want to encrypt from my file or if you have your own file.
6. Write down your key and end the program.
